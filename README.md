Automatic Identification System (AIS)
The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a real-time vessel tracking system mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for ships above a certain size, including commercial ships, passenger vessels, and large yachts. AIS transmits crucial navigational and positional information between ships, coastal stations, and satellites, helping to improve maritime safety, navigation efficiency, and environmental protection.

Key Features of AIS:
Real-Time Data Exchange: AIS broadcasts information such as ship identity (MMSI, IMO number), position (latitude, longitude), speed, course, and navigation status to nearby vessels and coastal authorities.
Collision Avoidance: By sharing real-time location data, AIS helps ships avoid collisions, especially in crowded or poor-visibility conditions.
Search and Rescue (SAR): AIS data supports search and rescue operations by providing the last known positions of vessels in distress.
Traffic Monitoring: Coastal stations and port authorities use AIS to monitor and manage vessel traffic, ensuring safe navigation through congested areas like ports and straits.
Environmental Monitoring: AIS plays a crucial role in monitoring maritime activities and identifying potential environmental risks, such as illegal dumping and oil spills.
